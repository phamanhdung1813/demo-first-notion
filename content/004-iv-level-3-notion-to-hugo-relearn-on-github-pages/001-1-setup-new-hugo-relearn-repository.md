Basically, you can use any existing Hugo Relearn repository because this will only sync the Notion page to two directories: `content` and `static` in the repository.


Alternatively, you can use [my premade skeleton-aws-workshop repository](https://github.com/heo001997/skeleton-aws-workshop). I’ve optimized the theme by fixing some UI/UX bugs, styling, and tweaking the GitHub workflow file to match my needs.


In this part, I’ll use [**GitHub import**](https://github.com/new/import)[ on that repo](https://github.com/new/import) to import into my [new Notion To Markdown repository](https://github.com/heo001997/aws-workshop-notion-to-md).

It’s done now. You can update your README and About sections if you want.
