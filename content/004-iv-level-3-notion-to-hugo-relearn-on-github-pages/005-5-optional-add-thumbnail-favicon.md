A website isn’t complete without a thumbnail and favicon. What if I told you that we can sync these images from Notion too? Amazing, right?


At the top of your Notion page, create a **“Toggle List”** named **“Custom Configuration”**. Inside it, create two more toggles: one for `thumbnail.png` and another for `favicon.png`. Add your images to the corresponding toggles.

[FYI] You can create a Toggle in Notion by typing `> space` at the start of a line.
