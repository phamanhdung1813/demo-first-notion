1. Why don’t we trigger a save on each Notion page change?

	⇒ Notion doesn’t support this kind of trigger, and I haven’t found any workaround for it.

2. How can I change Thumbnail and Favicon images?

	⇒ Check section **“IV. Level 3 - Notion to Hugo Relearn (on GitHub Pages)” → “5. (Optional) Add thumbnail & favicon.”**

3. I don’t want each Heading to create a new page. How can I avoid this?

	⇒ A new page will always be created for each Heading. You can prevent this by using any other Notion block type, such as Bullet points or Text, instead of Headings.

4. Why aren’t there more configuration options?

	⇒ This is a side project I worked on while doing my [**AWS First Cloud Journey**](https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/) course, so I didn’t have much time to add more features. I built it mainly for my personal use, so the current options are sufficient for me.

5. I want to contribute features. Is this project open-source?

	⇒ Yes, this project is completely open-source, and you’re very [welcome to contribute here](https://github.com/heo001997/notion-to-markdown).

6. Is my credential safe?

	⇒ Completely safe. We don’t store any of your credentials, and you can double-check our codebase if you’d like.

7. Where can I report bugs, and how can I fix them?

	⇒ You’re [welcome to open an issue here](https://github.com/heo001997/notion-to-markdown). Alternatively, you can submit a PR (pull request) to fix the issue by yourself.

8. Don’t you think the code looks pretty bad?

	⇒ You tell me! That’s the best I could do with an AI coder. I created this workshop and set everything up within a week. Feel free to refactor it for me or create a fork.
