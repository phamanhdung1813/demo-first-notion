Since our [Notion to Markdown website](https://notion-to-md.bamidev.com/) is 100% hosted on GitHub Pages, we **WILL NOT** store any of your information. Everything stays in your browser, and all requests will be made directly from it.


However, Notion’s CORS policy restricts these kinds of requests . We’ll use a **CORS Proxy** as a middleman to bypass this.


To use the **free CORS Proxy**, we input our free CORS Proxy URL.


(Optional) For convenience, I’ve added a proxy note. Clicking it will automatically fill in [`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) and open a new tab.

On the new tab, click **"Request temporary access"** to allow the use of this free CORS Proxy.

**DISCLAIMER:** 

1. **A CORS Proxy acts as a middleman**, meaning it can read all your requests and response credentials. Therefore, it is important to choose a trusted CORS Proxy or build your own for the highest level of security.
2. In this tutorial, we’ll use a **Free CORS Proxy URL** for convenience, please be fully aware of the **risk of exposing our NOTION credentials** (both requests and responses).
3. But to be honest, I’m not too concerned because we have already **limited our Notion token permissions** to **Read content** with **No user information**. Additionally, the **Notion URL is for a published page** (which is already public). So even in the worst-case scenario where we lose our **Notion credentials**, a hacker **cannot update or delete anything**—they would only be able to read the public and selected pages.
4. If you're still worried about security, you can use **your own CORS Proxy URL** or a **trusted CORS Proxy URL**. You are very welcome to do so.
5. The only time we use this **CORS Proxy** is when you **click "Convert"** to retrieve the Notion page information. **No other features or actions** will use this CORS Proxy.
